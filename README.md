# Sirraya Labs — Frontier Research in Computation & Systems

**Sirraya Labs** is an independent, open *frontier technology research organization* focused on exploring non-classical computation, information processing, decentralized systems, and physics-based computational frameworks.

We conduct **fundamental and applied research**, publish technical insights, develop protocols, and build reference implementations that advance understanding in:

- **AI & Machine Learning Interpretability**
- **Semantic Dynamics & Neural Representation**
- **Quantum-adjacent Computation and Cryptography**
- **Decentralized Protocols and Identity-Native Networking**
- **Secure Communication Protocols**
- **Optimization Systems & Quantum Algorithms**

Many of our research contributions — such as *Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics* for AI analysis and geometric frameworks for computation — are publicly documented and accessible. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Research Highlights & Publications

- **Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics** — A geometric framework to understand neural representations and detect hallucination in models. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Preprint frameworks in number theory and quantum error correction** authored by Sirraya Labs researchers. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
